# Analyzer
The analyzer script can automate the extraction of useful information about 
Defects4J Project, like the coverage of students' tests for tool, or
the extraction of all mutants generated by a tool.

The supported projects are Cli, Gson and Lang.

## Usage
The usage is `python3 analyzer.py <action> <path>`.

Check the `--help` to see all commands.

## Actions
### Coverage
This action will launch `defects4j coverage` against the student test suites related
to a single (or every) tool, obtaining the cobertura's coverage xmls about line and
branch coverage of the test suite provided.

### Mutants
This action will launch specified tools against a dummy test suite, containing only
an empty test function. This serves in reporting all the mutants generated by the tool.

PS: Judy won't generate any mutant with this method.

## Arguments
### Required args

#### action
Must be `coverage` or `mutants`.

#### path

### Optional args
