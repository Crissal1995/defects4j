# Analyzer
The analyzer script can automate the extraction of useful information about 
Defects4J Project, like the coverage of students' tests for tool, or
the extraction of all mutants generated by a tool.

The supported projects are Cli, Gson and Lang.

## Usage
The usage is `python3 analyzer.py <action> <path>`.

Check the `--help` to see all commands.

## Actions
### Backup
Backup the current testsuite. Is automatically performed when executing a testsuite changing command, like Coverage.

### Restore
Restore the backupped testsuite.

### Coverage
This action will launch `defects4j coverage` against the student test suites related
to a single (or every) tool, obtaining the cobertura's coverage xmls about line and
branch coverage of the test suite provided.

### Mutants
This action will launch specified tools against a dummy test suite, containing only
an empty test function. This serves in reporting all the mutants generated by the tool.

PS: Judy won't generate any mutant with this method.

### Mutscore
This action will launch specified tools against the selected testsuite, and then gets from the tool's output
the mutation score; other informations are automatically logged to the `tools_output` directory (inside the Subject path provided).

## Arguments
### Required args

#### action
Must be one of the aforementioned actions.

#### path
Must be the path of a checked out Defects4j project.

### Optional args

#### --tools
Specify a list of tools (space separated) to use during the elaboration of the action.
Valid values are `judy`, `jumble`, `major`, `pit`.

If not specified, every tool will be used.

#### --with-dev
Run the selected action including the developers tests.

Requires an inital `backup` action to work.

#### --skip-setup
Skip the setup of the tool (i.e. overwritting current testsuite with students' one),
executing the specified action against the current testsuite found in the right folder. 
Works only with `coverage`.

#### -v, --verbose
Increase the verbosity of output.

#### --stdout
Enable the stdout of the selected tools.

#### --stderr
Enable the stderr of the selected tools.
